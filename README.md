# Genomics Pipelines  
### Description:  
Automated pipelines, scripts, and command-line operations to perform data processing, analysis, and visualizations of genomics data. 

- Process NGS .fastq.gz raw reads using an automated script to produce .bam, .bw, and .bed files. Executed on a high-performance computing platform.  
- Perform downstream analysis such as differential gene expression, gene annotations, and motif discovery.  
- Analyze single-cell RNA-Seq data by clustering, differential gene expression, and trajectory inference.  
  
### Prerequisites:    
- Linux terminal/bash/shell and <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview" target="_blank">command-line usage</a>  
- Python and conda/virtualenv package management  
- R and RStudio  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Slurm job scheduling
